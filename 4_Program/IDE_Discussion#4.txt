IDE Discussion: IntelliJ IDEA

Being able to finally use an IDE is really great. Copying and Pasting is much faster for me with the mouse, this may be due to the fact
that I have used a mouse my whole life and not Vim. Possible cause there.
I started out using Eclipse, which I was also ok with. Everything worked fine, it corrected a lot of errors, besides being slow at times
it was really convenient. An issue I ran into with Eclipse was in transfering, exporting, and importing files on Eclipse. This turned out
to be a nightmare because earlier versions of Eclipse wouldn't compile the code, and it would compile on the command line either.
I found my savior in IntelliJ. After a frustrating few hours of trying to get the code I had written home to work at lab, a TA suggested
trying IntelliJ. I created a new project in IntelliJ and tossed my file in, drag and click. Once they were in the src file, IntelliJ
compiled them fine and adapted them to the current project. It was kind of amazing.

So nothing against Eclipse really, IntelliJ just made things easier for me so I chose to stick with it. Having now spent even more time
using it, I've found that I can change my editors theme, I can switch through tabs really easily, the layout if almost completely modular,
and I can set keyboard AND MOUSE shortcuts for editor commands. (IntelliJ understood my special mouse buttons, not just left and right click).
Pretty much never going to switch at this point.
