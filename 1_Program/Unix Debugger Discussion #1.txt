Unix Debugger Discussion

There weren't many occassions for this program that gdb became a necessary tool, although towards the end it was very useful.
After I had finished writing the destructors for all of the applicable classes I went to compile, which succeeded. Then I ran
the program which started fine, but on the delete of a temporary player pointer my program aborted with a double free
error. The player pointer was temporary because it was only used to receive the players information, after input was over the
temp player was deep copied into the LLL of Arrays data structure so it could be deleted and used for the next player. Stepping
through gdb I discovered the issue was in one of my player's data members; the friends list. The first deletion of a temp player
holder actually deleted the friends list, which was only a pointer to the real one that all players had access to. So when another
temp player holder was deleted and the friends list was deleted again, I experienced the error noted above.

Besides this, I was fortunate enough not to experience a signle segmentation fault during the entire process of creating this program
so gdb was not very necessary.
